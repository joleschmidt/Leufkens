# Active Context

## Current Focus
Enhancing the UX and content strategy based on "Expert Web Design" critique.
- Implemented "Zero-Friction" features: Prescription button, Appointment Form.
- Highlighted key medical differentiation (Diabetology).
- Added "News" section for dynamic updates.

## Recent Changes
- **Header**: Added "Rezept" quick-action button.
- **New Components**:
  - `AppointmentRequest.astro`: Digital appointment request form (mailto-based).
  - `News.astro`: Banner for latest updates (e.g., Flu shots).
- **Services**: Enhanced `Services.astro` to highlight "Diabetologie" with distinct styling.
- **Homepage**: Integrated new components into `index.astro`.

## Active Decisions
- **Form Handling**: Used `mailto` for the appointment form as a low-tech, static-friendly solution. Can be upgraded to Formspree later.
- **Design**: Maintained Teal/Stone palette but added high-contrast "Call to Action" elements.

## Next Steps
- **Review**: Check responsiveness of the new form and header button.
- **Content**: Replace placeholder images with real ones if/when available.
- **SEO**: Add schema markup for MedicalPractice.
