# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initialization of the Memory Bank to document the project state and guide future development. The project is currently a functioning Astro website with a complete homepage structure.

## Recent Changes
- **Project Structure**: Standard Astro layout with `src/pages`, `src/components`, `src/layouts`.
- **Dependencies**: Setup with Tailwind CSS v4, React, and Lucide React.
- **Content**: Home page (`index.astro`) implements Hero, Welcome, OpeningHours, Services, Team, and Contact sections.

## Active Decisions
- **Styling**: Using Tailwind CSS (v4) for rapid, utility-first styling.
- **Icons**: Using `lucide-react` for consistent iconography.
- **Framework**: Astro as the main framework for performance, with React for interactive components if needed (though mostly static so far).

## Next Steps
- **Review Components**: Verify the implementation of individual components (OpeningHours, Services, etc.) which were imported but not deep-dived yet.
- **Content Verification**: Ensure placeholder text/images are replaced with real content if available.
- **Feature Completion**: The `Testimonials` component is currently commented out in `index.astro`. Decide whether to implement or remove.
